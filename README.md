# NFFT-planar-and-angular-scan
This directory contains the python scripts (and their documentation) for making planar and angular scans of a near-field antenna's emission in order to characterize its beam. This project is part of a 2025 internship at the IAS (Institut d'Astrophysique Spatiale in Orsay, France).
